Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about customers.
 

Table: Orders

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| cost          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
Each customer has one order per day.
 

Write an SQL query to find the most recent 3 orders of each user. If a user ordered less than 3 orders return all of their orders.

Return the result table sorted by customer_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the customer_id in ascending order. If there still a tie, order them by the order_date in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Customers
+-------------+-----------+
| customer_id | name      |
+-------------+-----------+
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |
+-------------+-----------+

+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | cost |

Result table:

Jonathan has exactly 3 orders.
Marwan ordered only one time.
We sort the result table by customer_name in ascending order, by customer_id in ascending order and by order_date in descending order in case of a tie.
