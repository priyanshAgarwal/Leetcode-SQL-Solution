Result table:
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| customer_id | product_id | product_name |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| 1           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 1          | keyboard     |
| 2           | 2          | mouse        |

| 4           | 1          | keyboard     |
+-------------+------------+--------------+

Alice (customer 1) ordered the mouse three times and the keyboard one time, so the mouse is the most frquently ordered product for them.
Bob (customer 2) ordered the keyboard, the mouse, and the screen one time, so those are the most frquently ordered products for them.
Tom (customer 3) only ordered the screen (two times), so that is the most frquently ordered product for them.
Jerry (customer 4) only ordered the keyboard (one time), so that is the most frquently ordered product for them.
John (customer 5) did not order anything, so we do not include them in the result table.
