/*

613. Shortest Distance in a Line

Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
 

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
 

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.
 

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

-- Remember you don't havr to use group by for using MIN()

SELECT MIN(ABS(A.x - B.x)) AS shortest
FROM POINT A
INNER JOIN POINT B
ON A.X<>B.X
