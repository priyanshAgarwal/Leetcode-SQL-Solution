employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.
Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.

Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |

Result table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |

Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employees with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.

-- Method 1
SELECT employee_id, B.team_size FROM Employee A
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT team_id, COUNT(team_id) AS team_size   FROM Employee GROUP BY 1) AS B
ON A.team_id=B.team_id;

-- Method 2
/*
Remember there is no group by in OVER clause its always Partition by or Order By when using DENSE_RANK()
*/
SELECT employee_id, COUNT(team_id) OVER(PARTITION BY team_id) AS TEAM_SIZE FROM Employee;
