-- Very Intutuive Approach

WITH CTE AS (
SELECT
    ID,
    COMPANY,
    SALARY,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY COMPANY ORDER BY SALARY) AS ROW_SAL,
    COUNT(ID) OVER(PARTITION BY COMPANY) AS NUMBER_VALUE 
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY COMPANY, SALARY)

-- SELECT DISTINCT COMPANY,NUMBER_VALUE/2.0 , NUMBER_VALUE/2.0+1
-- FROM CTE


SELECT ID, COMPANY, SALARY
FROM CTE
WHERE ROW_SAL BETWEEN NUMBER_VALUE/2.0 AND NUMBER_VALUE/2.0+1;
