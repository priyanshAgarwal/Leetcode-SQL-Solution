| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |

| contest_id | percentage |
+------------+------------+
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
+------------+------------+
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%
